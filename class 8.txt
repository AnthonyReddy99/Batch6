Enterprise Blockchains:
-----------------------

Reference links ---> https://www.hyperledger.org/


 Sawtooth, Iroha, Burrow, Indy, Fabric, Corda

90% ----> Fabric (praticals and labs on fabric)

1. Security
2. Faster block creation (uses diff consensus)
3. No anonimity
4. No Transaction/block fee

}




Iroha:
------
1. PBFT
2. Light weight client applications

Indy:
-----
1. DID's


 generateDID (name, age, mobile, mail) -----> DID0980-9890jhghgkh97979

Name: Akshay , Graduate

 DID1 --> college fee reiumbersment program
 DID2 --> Scholarships from international colleges
 DID3 --> graduation details for eligible


Burrow/Besu:
-------------
1. ethereum specific use cases
2. solidty for smart comtracts
3. no gas fee/txn fee
4. can be used by enterprises
 




 Ethereum --- solidity, web3.js, ethers.js
 Indy     --- Decentralized identity (read thru)
 Fabric   --- 80% of enterprise adopt this (node js, java, golang)
 Corda    --- (java, kotlin)
